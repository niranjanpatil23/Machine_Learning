Machine Learning Algorithms using Python

**Regression, Classification and KNN** <br />
**1. Linear Regression:**<br />
Developed a regularized Linear Regression model to predict Wine Quality. Trained UCI Wine Quality Dataset and used validation set to tune regularized hyper-parameter lambda giving lowest mean square error.<br />
**2. Logistic Regression:**<br />
Implemented gradient descent to train parameters of logistic regression model. Used MNIST dataset of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. The implemented model is only able to classify the dataset linearly, i.e., classifying digits less than 5 and digits more than 5.<br />
**3. K Nearest Neighbours:**<br />
Implemented kNN classifier to classify handwritten digits from MNIST dataset into 0 to 9.Found best k giving the best classification accuracy on the validation set. <br />
